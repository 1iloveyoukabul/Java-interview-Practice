package abstruction;

public class Note {
	//abstraction provides no implementation
	// interface is designed for 100% abstraction
	// abstraction call is partial abstract
	
// abstruction is called contract.What kind of contract is? it is API which satands 
//	Application program interface)
	
// 1- created list of contract in the interface and I will implement them in the BMW/toyota classes
}// 2- Can we have extnds two interface? Yes with keyword extends
// interface will not have method because it is not a class

// 3- we can not have copy of the interface becaus it dose not have consturctor
//interface will be the parant of the classes

// 4- if need to creat a method in the interface then I should have static method
/// Emample public static int sum( int a)
// return a;
